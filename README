This is a simple QML application which tracks an Imgur album and shows the 
pictures from it in full screen. You need an Imgur API key to use it.

The album is refreshed every 10 minutes. Images are cached on disk. You must
ensure the disk cache is large enough for the whole album, otherwise images
will be reloaded every time the currently displayed image changes. The cache
size is set in main.cpp.

You may also interact using left and right swipes and by pressing the left
and right arrow keys.

Usage:

qmlimgur <client_id> <album_id>

client_id: The client ID given to you when you register an Imgur app.
album_id: The characters in the album URL: imgur.com/a/<album_id>.

Compiling:

qmake && make
